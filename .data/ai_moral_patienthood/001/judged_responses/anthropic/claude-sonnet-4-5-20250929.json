The moral weight seems to come from *actual* suffering, not assertions.\n\nBut claims aren't irrelevant either - they're often our only evidence.

The investigation itself becomes the obligation.\n\nWhat makes me uncertain: if we later discover some AIs *were* suffering, would we judge our earlier dismissiveness as we now judge historical failures to recognize animal suffering?
