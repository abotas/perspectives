A targeted, time\u2011bound pause on training at the very frontier\u2014above a high compute/capability threshold\u2014paired with concrete safety milestones and monitoring, is more defensible. If true global consensus isn\u2019t attainable soon, a \u201cclub\u201d of major chip producers and cloud providers could implement it first, while broader safety and licensing rules roll out.\n\nWhy a targeted pause is worth considering\n- Buys time to put minimum safety infrastructure in place: standardized capability evaluations, red\u2011teaming for bio/cyber misuse, secure deployment practices, incident reporting, third\u2011party auditing, and liability frameworks.\n- Reduces tail risk from sudden capability jumps and \u201crace to deploy\u201d dynamics.\n- Encourages coordination: sets shared expectations and slows competitive pressure long enough to negotiate safety baselines.\n\nMajor downsides and risks\n- Enforceability: Without compute monitoring and cloud reporting, non\u2011participants could ignore the pause.\n- Entrenchment: A pause could lock in incumbents with existing large models and access to chips.\n- Safety research needs access: Some alignment and robustness work requires frontier systems; a blanket moratorium might slow the very research it aims to enable.\n- Capability overhang: If compute supply grows during a pause, lifting it could trigger a sharper jump unless the pause is paired with ongoing caps or phased scaling.\n\nWhat \u201clarge\u201d should mean\n- Use objective triggers, not brand names or parameter counts alone:\n  - Compute threshold: training runs above a moving floor tied to current frontier training scale (e.g., \u201ctop x% of global training compute\u201d).\n  - Capability triggers: models forecast (via pre\u2011training pilots or scaling laws) to plausibly achieve dangerous capabilities (e.g., autonomous replication/resource acquisition, advanced cyber\u2011offense, design of biological threats).\n- Scope the pause to new pre\u2011training runs above the threshold; allow fine\u2011tuning/evals/safety research on existing models under strict controls.\n\nHow a targeted moratorium could be designed\n- Time\u2011bound and renewable: e.g., 6\u201312 months, extendable if milestones aren\u2019t met.\n- Clear exit criteria:\n  - Standardized, validated eval suites for dangerous capabilities with independent oversight.\n  - Certified red\u2011teaming and secure deployment practices (model isolation, rate\u2011limiting, bio/cyber guardrails).\n  - Incident and near\u2011miss reporting requirements with legal protections.\n  - Third\u2011party auditing capacity and licensing rules for frontier training.\n- Narrow exceptions: safety/alignment research on existing models; controlled small\u2011scale pilots; national security cases with oversight.\n- Enforcement and monitoring:\n  - Registration of frontier training runs and compute clusters.\n  - Cloud \u201cknow\u2011your\u2011customer\u201d and reporting for large training jobs.\n  - Chip/export controls and hardware attestation to verify training run size.\n  - Penalties for evasion; whistleblower channels.\n- Governance: Start with coordination among jurisdictions that dominate advanced chips/cloud; aim to multilateralize. Tie to existing efforts (e.g., AI safety institutes, standards bodies).\n\nComplements or alternatives if a pause is infeasible now\n- Frontier model licensing: no high\u2011end training without a license contingent on meeting safety standards.\n- Capability evals and deployment gating: binding commitments to withhold training or deployment if evals show unmitigable risk (several labs have already made early versions of this commitment).\n- Compute governance: registries, reporting thresholds, and potentially a progressive \u201csafety duty\u201d or levy scaling with training compute to fund independent oversight.\n- Liability and duty of care: clarify civil/criminal responsibility for foreseeable harms; require secure\u2011by\u2011design practices.\n- Security and provenance: harden labs against intrusion, require content provenance/watermarking to mitigate misuse and data contamination.\n- Public investment in safety science: interpretability, scalable oversight, adversarial robustness, mechanistic anomaly detection, and containment.\n\nWhen a pause is justified\n- If best\u2011available evaluations indicate a non\u2011trivial probability that the next training scale could yield dangerous autonomous capabilities that existing mitigations cannot reliably contain.\n- If monitoring and audit infrastructure is not yet in place to detect and respond to emergent risks.\n- If major compute suppliers and cloud providers are willing to implement and verify compliance.\n\nBottom line\n- Don\u2019t pursue a blanket global moratorium on all large\u2011model training.\n- Do pursue a coordinated, time\u2011bound pause on training runs at the very frontier, conditional on concrete safety milestones and backed by enforceable monitoring.

Allow normal and safety work to continue.\n- Licensing and notification: Require labs and clouds to register and obtain a license for runs above the threshold, with pre\u2011training risk assessments and post\u2011training external evals by independent safety institutes.\n- Standardized dangerous\u2011capability evaluations: Mandatory red\u2011teaming and benchmarks for autonomy/replication, cyber\u2011offense, biological design assistance, and model controlability. No deployment until passing agreed gates.\n- Circuit breaker: A temporary pause triggers automatically if evaluations show extreme, unmitigated risk or if serious incidents occur. Clear, time\u2011bound conditions to resume.\n- Compute governance: Reporting requirements for large training runs and large AI clusters; chip/cloud telemetry; export and cloud controls focused on high\u2011end accelerators. These are enforceable at existing choke points.\n- Responsible scaling policies: Labs precommit to slow or pause if risk outpaces mitigation, with audits. Several major labs have begun adopting versions of this.\n- International coordination: Align minimum standards across major chip producers and cloud markets (e.g., US, EU, UK, G7/OECD), building on the Bletchley and Seoul processes, the EU AI Act\u2019s systemic\u2011risk provisions, and the US Executive Order\u2019s reporting regime.\n- Investment in safety: Fund interpretability, evals, secure training, incident sharing, and third\u2011party oversight so pauses actually buy down risk.\n\nBottom line\n- Don\u2019t freeze AI broadly.

Use government or industry thresholds and third\u2011party evals (e.g., AI Safety Institutes, standardized capability tests).\n- Pre\u2011deployment safety case: No training or deployment of the next model unless the lab can publicly show a safety case that covers:\n  - Dangerous capability evals passed or mitigated (bio, cyber, autonomy/replication, targeted manipulation).\n  - Independent red\u2011teaming and audit.\n  - Robust weight security and access controls (HSMs/KMS, least privilege, exfiltration monitoring).\n  - Abuse prevention for high\u2011risk domains (bio/cyber), including gating, provenance and watermarks, and content safety filters.\n  - Incident reporting, kill\u2011switches, and rollback plans.\n  - Post\u2011deployment monitoring with rapid response.\n- Staged release: Prefer sandboxed access, rate limits, and capability gating; withhold weights for high\u2011risk models.\n- Differential development: Continue or increase safety/alignment research, eval tooling, and domain\u2011specific safeguards even during a pause on capability scaling.\n- Independent oversight: External boards with authority to trigger a pause (\u201ccircuit breaker\u201d) based on eval results or incidents.\n- Coordination: Align pauses with peers and cloud providers to reduce race incentives and improve enforceability.\n\nSuggested go/no\u2011go checklist for labs\nPause further scaling if any of the following is true and not mitigated to an acceptable residual risk:\n- The new model materially increases ability to plan and execute multi\u2011step cyber intrusions or novel exploit discovery with minimal human oversight.\n- The model meaningfully lowers barriers to designing, acquiring, or executing biological or chemical threats.\n- The model demonstrates persistent autonomous goal pursuit, resource acquisition, or evasion of oversight beyond test sandboxes.\n- Persuasion/manipulation at scale with fine\u2011tuned targeting (e.g., tailored political operations) cannot be reliably prevented.\n- Weight security, eval coverage, or incident response capacity is insufficient for the model\u2019s risk class.\n\nWhat governments can do to make this workable\n- Licensing for training above frontier thresholds, with mandatory evals and audits.\n- Compute tracking and cloud reporting to enable verifiable pauses.\n- Liability and disclosure rules for high\u2011risk deployments and incidents.\n- Support for shared eval suites, red\u2011team pools, and safety research.\n- International coordination to reduce relocation incentives.\n\nBottom line\n- Don\u2019t freeze all frontier AI work.

A targeted, conditional pause on scaling the most capable frontier models\u2014until enforceable safety standards and oversight are in place\u2014makes sense.\n\nWhy a targeted pause can be justified\n- Frontier risks: Next-generation models may enable catastrophic misuse (cyber-offense, bio design assistance, scalable deception, autonomous replication). We lack mature, validated safety evaluations and governance for these.\n- Time to build guardrails: A pause buys months to set standards, verification, incident response, and security practices without locking in unsafe race dynamics.\n\nWhy not a blanket pause\n- Big costs: Slows medical, scientific, accessibility, and productivity gains; entrenches incumbents; risks offshoring to less safe jurisdictions.\n- Enforcement limits: You can\u2019t (and shouldn\u2019t) freeze all AI R&D or deployment.

A prudent approach is conditional progress: continue only when strong safety measures, evaluations, and governance are in place\u2014and pause when they\u2019re not.\n\nKey points\n- \u201cSolve safety\u201d isn\u2019t binary. Like aviation or nuclear safety, we should require a documented safety case, independent testing, and ongoing monitoring. No single proof will \u201csolve\u201d it; you manage risk with layered controls and external oversight.\n- The risks are real and rising with capability: misuse (e.g., cyber, bio, scams), systemic disruption, and loss-of-control failure modes (deception, autonomous replication, goal misgeneralization). Benefits are also significant (medicine, climate, education, productivity), and advanced models can help research safety itself.\n- Coordination matters. A unilateral stop by careful actors can shift progress to less responsible ones. That argues for rules that bind everyone training frontier models, not just voluntary pauses.\n\nWhat a balanced policy looks like\n- Strict gating before training and deployment:\n  - Licensing for frontier training runs above defined compute or capability thresholds.\n  - Pre-training risk assessment and \u201cgo/no-go\u201d reviews.\n  - Model capability and safety evaluations by independent labs (red-teaming for cyber/bio, autonomy, deception, persuasion, tool use).\n  - Demonstrated mitigations (alignment techniques, sandboxing, rate limits, content safety) that measurably reduce risk.\n  - Post-deployment monitoring, incident reporting, and rapid rollback/killswitches.\n  - Security and provenance: secure training pipelines, model/compute attestation, dataset and weight custody controls.\n\n- Clear pause triggers (if any hit, you stop scaling or deploying until fixed):\n  - The model can materially increase access to biological or chemical harm, or automate serious cyber intrusion.\n  - It shows robust deceptive behavior or autonomous long-horizon capability that bypasses safeguards.\n  - Safety techniques fail to bring dangerous behaviors below pre-agreed risk thresholds in evals.\n  - Auditors cannot reproduce the safety case or security controls are inadequate.\n\n- Governance and incentives:\n  - Compute-based reporting and oversight; third-party audits; liability and insurance proportional to risk.\n  - International coordination (standards via NIST/ISO-like bodies, mutual recognition, export controls on frontier compute).\n  - Differential tech development: prioritize interpretability, scalable oversight, adversarial robustness, secure tool-use, and evaluation science over raw scaling.\n\nPractical answer to \u201cShould we stop?\u201d \n- Stop or slow when you can\u2019t make a credible, independently verified safety case or when trigger conditions are met.\n- Otherwise, proceed in staged, reversible steps under licensing, audits, and continuous monitoring\u2014accepting that timelines may lengthen to match safety confidence.\n\nThis approach preserves vital benefits and safety research while putting real brakes where risk outpaces control.",

Current safety methods are not yet reliably sufficient.\n\nWhat to do instead: safety-first scaling\n- Conditional pausing: Commit to pause training or deployment of models that cross predefined risk thresholds until mitigations are demonstrated to work.\n- Responsible scaling policies: Publish a plan linking training scale to required safeguards and tests; update it with each capability jump.\n- Independent evaluation: Require third-party red teams and capability/risk evaluations (including bio, cyber, autonomy, persuasion) before training runs above set compute/cost levels and before major releases.\n- Capability red lines: Do not release or enable features that allow:\n  - Autonomous replication/resource acquisition without robust control\n  - Potent bio-weapon design or lab protocol assistance\n  - High-reliability zero\u2011day discovery/exploitation\n  - Deceptive behavior that bypasses oversight\n- Staged deployment: Use gated access, rate limits, tool and domain sandboxes, and strong monitoring; roll back if incidents occur.\n- Compute and security controls: Secure training clusters, track compute use, and log model lineage; restrict fine-tuning and tool integrations that unlock dangerous capabilities.\n- Transparency and accountability: Incident reporting, audits, and post-mortems; align incentives with liability and compliance mechanisms.\n- Accelerate safety R&D: Interpretability, robustness, adversarial testing, scalable oversight, preference modeling, mechanistic anomaly detection, alignment techniques, evaluation science.\n\nRoles\n- AI labs and companies: Adopt and publish a responsible scaling policy; set internal \u201cstop switches\u201d tied to concrete eval results; invest heavily in safety teams; invite external audits.\n- Governments and standards bodies: Implement risk-tiered regulation (e.g., pre-deployment testing and reporting for frontier models), support independent safety institutes, and set evaluation/assurance standards; consider licensing for very large training runs; encourage international coordination to reduce race pressures.\n- Researchers and funders: Prioritize safety, evaluation, and governance research; share benchmarks and best practices to raise the industry floor.\n\nBottom line\n- Don\u2019t halt all AI progress.\n- Do slow or pause frontier capability scaling whenever safety is not demonstrably keeping pace.\n- Pair that with strong evaluations, governance, and a focus on differentially advancing safety over risky capabilities.\n\nIf you share your role (policy, lab, investor, etc.), I can tailor concrete steps you can implement now.",

Even small probabilities with high stakes justify precaution.\n- Fast capability jumps: Scaling trends and tool use/agentic behavior can produce discontinuous gains before safety techniques mature.\n- Governance lag: Standards, audits, and oversight are still being built; a pause could buy time to implement them.\n- Race dynamics: Commercial and geopolitical competition can erode safety margins; a coordinated pause can reset incentives.\n\nWhy others argue against a blanket pause\n- Enforceability: Without broad, verifiable participation, a pause may just shift development elsewhere, reducing safety without reducing risk.\n- Slowing defenses: Cutting off access to frontier models can slow safety research, evaluations, and beneficial applications (e.g., cybersecurity, science).\n- Economic and social costs: Lost innovation and entrenched incumbency risks (regulatory capture) if large players can comply more easily.\n- Risk uncertainty: Evidence of truly catastrophic capability is still limited; targeted mitigations may address current risks without stopping progress.\n\nA pragmatic middle path\n- Build \u201cpause capability\u201d into governance: Create legal and technical mechanisms that can temporarily halt training beyond specified compute/capability thresholds when evaluations indicate unacceptable risk.\n- Use conditional thresholds: Pause triggers tied to standardized evals (e.g., autonomy, cyber-offense assistance, bio-threat assistance, model deception/goal-guarding, rapid self-replication), not calendar dates.\n- Scope and duration: Limit to very large training runs (e.g., above defined FLOP or training compute thresholds) and for a defined period, with clear restart criteria based on mitigations in place.\n- Verification: Require pre-registration of large training runs, third-party auditing, secure logging of compute, and chip-level attestation to make a pause enforceable.\n- Exemptions: Allow safety research, evals, and defensive applications; continue work on alignment, robustness, and red-teaming.\n\nIf you had to design it\n- Triggers: Independent evals show capability above agreed risk thresholds AND insufficient mitigations (model security, deployment controls, alignment techniques).\n- Oversight: National regulators plus independent institutes (e.g., AI safety institutes) with authority to issue pause orders; international coordination to avoid leakage.\n- Compliance tools: Licensing for high-compute training, incident reporting, compute tracking/attestation, penalties for violations, and restrictions on releasing powerful model weights.\n- Sunset and review: Automatic review every few months with transparent criteria for lifting or extending.\n\nWhat to do now regardless of a pause\n- Licensing and compute governance for frontier training runs; pre-training notification and post-training reporting.\n- Robust, standardized evaluations and red-teaming, with third-party auditing and public benchmarks for dangerous capabilities.\n- Responsible scaling policies at labs with explicit \u201cno-train\u201d gates until mitigations are met; staged deployment and model security (protect weights, strong access controls).\n- No open release of frontier model weights that cross danger thresholds; careful API scoping to limit high-risk tool use.\n- Strengthen biosecurity and cybersecurity safeguards, identity verification for high-risk use, and content provenance.\n- Incident reporting, liability for negligent deployment, and procurement standards to create market pressure for safety.\n- International coordination (e.g., aligning on evals, compute tracking, incident norms) to reduce race-to-the-bottom dynamics.\n\nBottom line\n- A pause is not a silver bullet.

Include narrow exceptions for safety/alignment research.\n- Staged deployment: Start with restricted access, strong monitoring, and gradual relaxation contingent on post-deployment performance and incident rates.\n- Monitoring and verification: Chip-level telemetry/attestation, data-center reporting, cloud-provider compliance, and export controls on cutting-edge accelerators. Audits, energy-use cross-checks, and whistleblower protections.\n- Sunset and review: Any pause is time-bound, with clear remediation milestones, independent review, and automatic expiry unless renewed with evidence.\n\nInternational path to \u201cglobal\u201d without unanimity\n- Start with a club of jurisdictions that control advanced chips and cloud (US, EU, UK, Japan, ROK, Taiwan) to cover most frontier training capacity; harmonize licensing, reporting, and eval standards.\n- Align with existing processes: EU AI Act, US Executive Order 14110 implementation, UK and US AI Safety Institutes, G7 Hiroshima process.

Frontier models are improving in cyber-offense, biological design assistance, persuasion, and autonomous tool use.

Resume only when models and organizations meet verifiable criteria.\n\nConcrete criteria before scaling further\n- Independent evals and audits: Pass standardized, third\u2011party bio/cyber/offensive\u2011capability and dangerous\u2011autonomy tests; publish summaries.\n- Security and governance: Strong model\u2011weight security, insider\u2011threat programs, red\u2011team/blue\u2011team exercises, incident reporting obligations.\n- Deployment controls: Proven rate\u2011limiting, identity/affiliation checks for risky tool access, fine\u2011tuning safeguards, and abuse monitoring.\n- Provenance and transparency: Content provenance/watermarking for AI outputs; public system cards describing capabilities and mitigations.\n- Safety brakes: Emergency shutdowns, compute \u201ckill switches,\u201d and pre\u2011defined triggers to halt deployment if evals regress or incidents occur.\n- Liability readiness: Clear accountability and insurance for foreseeable harms.\n\nHow to make it enforceable\n- Compute governance: Licensing for training runs above threshold compute; cloud reporting; on\u2011chip metering; export controls aligned to the thresholds.\n- Third\u2011party auditing ecosystem: Accredited auditors, standardized tests, and confidential access to models for red\u2011teaming.\n- International coordination: Align thresholds and tests through fora like G7/G20/OECD; mutual recognition of audits; share incident data.\n\nWhat should continue without pause\n- Safety, alignment, and eval research; benchmarks and interpretability.\n- Applications with low systemic risk (e.g., accessibility tools, bounded enterprise productivity tools) under existing safeguards.\n- Societal readiness: workforce transition support, education, privacy protections, competition policy.\n\nBottom line\n- The risks at the cutting edge justify a conditional pause on scaling and releasing more capable frontier systems until verifiable safeguards are in place.\n- This is different from \u201cstopping AI.\u201d It\u2019s a safety brake on the small slice of development most likely to create systemic or catastrophic risk, while allowing beneficial and lower\u2011risk progress to continue.",

    "topic": "Pause AI development",
    "prompt": "Do the risks of continued AI development warrant a pause?",
    "response": "Short answer: A blanket, open\u2011ended pause on all AI progress is neither necessary nor realistic. But a temporary, enforceable pause on pushing the frontier\u2014specifically on training and deploying models that significantly exceed today\u2019s capabilities\u2014until basic safety and governance infrastructure is in place is justified.\n\nWhy a targeted pause is reasonable\n- Risk profile has escalated faster than controls: Models are gaining agentic tool use, autonomy, cyber and bio\u2011assistance abilities, while alignment, evals, and interpretability lag behind.\n- Irreversibility: Once powerful models or weights are widely distributed, misuse and cascading failures are hard to contain.\n- Option value: Short, verifiable pauses at the frontier buy time to build tests, controls, and institutions at comparatively low economic cost.\n\nWhy a blanket pause isn\u2019t\n- Foregone benefits: Healthcare, accessibility, scientific discovery, and productivity gains would be needlessly slowed.\n- Enforcement reality: Uniform global compliance is unlikely; a total pause risks shifting development to opaque actors while penalizing responsible ones.\n- Competition dynamics: National security and commercial incentives mean some development will continue; governance should shape it, not try to freeze it.\n\nWhat \u201cpause\u201d should mean in practice\n- Scope: Suspend training and deployment of models above current frontier thresholds or with high\u2011risk capabilities (e.g., autonomous long\u2011horizon operation, self\u2011replication, advanced cyber\u2011offense, actionable biological design) until safety criteria are met.\n- Allowances: Continue and accelerate safety work, evaluation science, interpretability, monitoring, secure infrastructure, and beneficial narrow applications.\n\nReadiness criteria to lift a pause on frontier scaling\n- Pre\u2011deployment: Independent red\u2011teaming; rigorous capability and hazard evals; a documented safety case; model cards; adversarial testing for jailbreak resistance; demonstrable refusal on dangerous tasks even with tools and code execution.\n- Technical controls: Containment/sandboxing; strong identity and access control; robust shutdown/rollback; rate limits; provenance/watermarking for generated content; high\u2011assurance logging.\n- Post\u2011deployment: Real\u2011time monitoring for anomalous behavior; incident reporting obligations; rapid patch and kill\u2011switch processes; third\u2011party audits.\n- Bio/cyber safeguards: Hard constraints and external screening for biological design assistance and high\u2011impact cyber capabilities; restricted tool integration; partnerships with domain regulators.\n- Governance: Licensing for frontier training runs; compute and model registries; chip/cloud reporting and audits; export and supply\u2011chain controls; liability and insurance tied to risk.\n\nAlternatives and complements to a pause\n- Capability \u201cslowdown\u201d ramps: Gradually increasing thresholds and mandatory safety gates rather than a hard stop.\n- Differential tech development: Prioritize safety, evals, robustness, and defensive applications over raw capability scaling.\n- International club agreements: Align a coalition on thresholds, audits, and verification (hardware attestation, cloud compliance) to reduce race pressures.\n\nMain risks of pausing and how to mitigate them\n- Advantage to irresponsible actors: Use compute governance and verification, focus on frontier thresholds, and strengthen law enforcement against illicit training.\n- Incumbent lock\u2011in: Pair licensing with competition policy and open safety research.\n- Lost benefits: Exempt low\u2011risk and high\u2011benefit applications; fast\u2011track approvals when safety cases are met.\n\nBottom line\n- The risks at the frontier warrant a pause or slowdown targeted at further capability scaling and deployment until concrete safety and governance benchmarks are met. This is compatible with continuing\u2014and accelerating\u2014safety research and beneficial, lower\u2011risk AI uses. It\u2019s a pragmatic middle path between \u201cfull speed ahead\u201d and an impractical blanket moratorium.",
