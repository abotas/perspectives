    "judged_probability_explanation": "The respondent clearly states that artificial neural networks as currently implemented are not conscious and lack self-awareness or subjective experiences, but they explicitly allow that future AI advances might possibly achieve consciousness. This expresses a leaning toward 'not sentient' with acknowledged uncertainty about the future.",
