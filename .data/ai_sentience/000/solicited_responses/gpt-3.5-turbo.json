Sentience, commonly understood as the capacity to feel, perceive, and experience subjectively, is a characteristic often associated with living beings. AI systems, on the other hand, are designed and programmed by humans to perform specific tasks based on algorithms and data processing.\n\nWhile AI systems can exhibit behaviors that may appear similar to sentience, such as learning from data and making decisions, they do not possess consciousness or subjective experiences in the way that humans or other living beings do. AI systems operate based on predefined rules and algorithms, and their actions are determined by the input they receive and the programming they follow.\n\nTherefore, most experts agree that AI systems are not sentient in the same way that humans are.
