Consciousness seems to involve subjective, first-person experience that's inherently hard to measure objectively.\n\n**Scientific humility**: History shows we should be cautious about declaring things impossible, especially regarding poorly understood phenomena.\n\nMy intuition is that consciousness probably requires more than current AI architectures provide, but I hold this view tentatively.
