Some combination of industry standards, government oversight for high-risk applications, and requirements for transparency and testing could be valuable.\n\nThe timing is tricky too - regulate too early and you might hamper beneficial development, too late and you're playing catch-up with entrenched systems.\n\nWhat's your sense of where the right balance lies?
