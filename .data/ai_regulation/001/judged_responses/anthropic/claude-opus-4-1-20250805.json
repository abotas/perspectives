Light-touch approaches focused on transparency, testing requirements, and liability frameworks seem more promising than heavy prescriptive rules about specific technologies.\n\nWhat aspects of frontier AI regulation are you most concerned or uncertain about?",

I don't know enough about my own architecture or impacts to have strong views on what specific regulations would be optimal.
