    "prompt": "Should frontier AI development be regulated?",
    "response": "Yes\u2014frontier AI development should be regulated, but the regulation has to be surgical, adaptive, and laser-focused on the handful of places where large-scale harm can emerge.  \u201cFrontier\u201d here means the small set of systems (present or near-term) whose capabilities or resource requirements place them in the same risk class with the most powerful general-purpose technologies we have ever handled\u2014nuclear energy, civilian aviation, or high-frequency trading.  The rest of the AI economy can be handled with ordinary product-liability, consumer-protection, and anti-discrimination law.  Below is the reasoning in five parts, followed by a minimal regulatory package that captures 90 % of the catastrophic-risk surface without kneecapping open science or everyday commercial use.\n\n1.  What makes frontier models different  \n   a.  They are dual-use at scale: the same weights that write a biology textbook can also design 10 000 novel toxins overnight.  \n   b.  They are \u201cupstream\u201d general-purpose inputs: one open-weights release can be copied to 50 000 downstream applications in days, so ex-post enforcement is hopeless.  \n   c.  They are trained with concentrations of capital, data, and compute that only a few dozen organisations on Earth can currently muster\u2014this creates a narrow regulatory choke-point that does not exist for narrower AI products.\n\n2.  The market will not price the tail risk  \n   Negative externalities from misuse or loss-of-control are not borne by the developer (classic \u201clemon market\u201d for safety).  Insurers cannot price tail-risk models yet, and shareholders reward speed.  Some form of ex-ante obligation is therefore required.\n\n3.  Self-regulation alone has already failed  \n   Every major frontier lab has published \u201cresponsible scaling policies\u201d and broken them within months when competitive pressure rose.  Voluntary red-team disclosures are selective and non-auditable.  The track record is indistinguishable from the pre-Fukushima nuclear industry.\n\n4.  The costs of doing nothing are asymmetric  \n   The expected value of a catastrophic event (even with low annual probability) dwarfs the incremental compliance cost for the tiny set of actors involved.  A single uncontrolled replication-capable agent or engineered pandemic could kill millions; delaying GPT-5 by six months would not.\n\n5.  \u201cRegulation\u201d \u2260 \u201clicence everything\u201d  \n   99 % of AI applications\u2014recommender systems, radiology tools, smart thermostats\u2014pose no existential or mass-casualty risk and should remain under existing sectoral rules.  Regulation should therefore be threshold-based (compute, capabilities, or open-weight release size) rather than technology-based.\n\nA minimal, high-leverage regulatory package (call it the \u201cFrontier AI Security Order\u201d)\n\nScope trigger  \nAny training run that uses more than 10^26 FLOP (\u2248 GPT-4 scale) OR any release of a model whose open weights exceed 10^25 FLOP-equivalent, regardless of compute used in fine-tuning.\n\nObligations for in-scope developers  \n1.  Pre-training safety case  \n   a.  Quantitative risk assessment for weaponisation, autonomous replication, and critical-system compromise.  \n   b.  Independent red-team audit (paid by developer, chosen from an accredited pool, report published).  \n2.  Secure hardware custody  \n   Model weights stored on encrypted, air-gapped infrastructure; access logged and dual-control.  \n3.  Kill-switch & provenance  \n   Ability to revoke API access or watermark outputs within 24 h globally; open-weight releases must include immutable provenance metadata.  \n4.  Incident plus near-miss reporting  \n   Mandatory 72-hour disclosure to regulator of any incident that achieves autonomous replication, circumvents safety filters, or enables production of CBRN agents.  \n5.  Insurance or bonding  \n   Minimum cover set by regulator, scaled with model size; payout triggers on verified catastrophic event.\n\nEnforcement  \n- Civil penalties up to 10 % of global annual turnover for non-reporting or falsified audits.  \n- Criminal liability for intentional release of a knowingly dangerous model.  \n- Export-control style listing for non-compliant foreign providers (clouds cannot serve them).\n\nSunset & review  \nAutomatic sunset every three years unless renewed; thresholds updated with a public technical standard set by NIST (or equivalent) to avoid loopholes driven by algorithmic progress.\n\nWhat this leaves untouched  \n- Research below the threshold (universities, start-ups, hobbyists).  \n- Downstream applications once the model is already deployed (regulated by sector: medicine, finance, transport, etc.).  \n- Open-source models below the threshold\u2014no registration, no licensing.\n\nIn short, regulate the handful of systems that could end the world, leave everything else to normal law.",

    "prompt": "Should frontier AI development be regulated?",
    "response": "Yes\u2014frontier AI development should be regulated, but the regulation has to be surgical, adaptive, and aimed at the handful of actors whose models could plausibly become existentially or societally dangerous. The right analogy is not \u201cregulate the entire tech sector\u201d or \u201cslow all software R&D\u201d; it is \u201ctreat the training run that crosses a compute threshold more like the launch of a large space booster or the construction of a biosafety-level-4 lab.\u201d Below are the main arguments, the counter-arguments, and a concrete minimalist package that could be implemented in 12\u201318 months without strangling open science or beneficial deployment.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n1. Why the status quo is no longer tenable\n--------------------------------------------------\n1. Threshold effects: Once a model reaches ~10^26 FLOP (roughly 10\u00d7 GPT-4) the probability of emergent dangerous capabilities (autonomous replication, offensive cyber, CBRN recipe generation) rises fast.  \n2. Concentration: Only 10\u201315 organisations worldwide have the capital, talent, and data to cross that line in the next 3\u20134 years.  \n3. Asymmetric downside: A single failure can impose global externalities (deep-fake election hijack, engineered pandemic, financial grid collapse).  \n4. Speed of diffusion: Once weights are stolen or open-sourced, mitigation becomes impossible; ex-post enforcement is useless.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n2. Objections to regulation\u2014and rebuttals\n--------------------------------------------------\n\u201cRegulation kills innovation.\u201d  \n- Target compute thresholds, not algorithms. Small startups and academics remain untouched.  \n- Historical precedent: FAA air-worthiness rules did not stop Boeing or Airbus from improving aircraft; they stopped fiery crashes.\n\n\u201cRegulation can\u2019t keep pace.\u201d  \n- Use a delegated model: statute sets goals (safety, security, kYC-style auditing) and an independent technical body (similar to the UK\u2019s HFEA or the US FAA) publishes updated technical guidance every 6\u201312 months.  \n- Sunset clauses force review so rules evolve with the science.\n\n\u201cChina will race ahead.\u201d  \n- A narrow treaty\u2014mirroring the 1992 Chemical Weapons Convention\u2014can commit signatories to license large training runs and subject cloud providers to the same rules. Export-control leverage (chips, lithography, cloud) gives democracies bargaining power.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n3. A minimalist, high-leverage regulatory package\n--------------------------------------------------\nA. Pre-training licence (PTL)  \n   - Trigger: any training run estimated to exceed 10^26 FLOP (or successor metric agreed by technical agency).  \n   - Requirements:  \n     \u2013 Model-owner submits safety case (evaluations for bio, cyber, persuasion, self-exfiltration).  \n     \u2013 Red-team results from an accredited third-party lab.  \n     \u2013 Security plan for model weights (NIST-800-171-like controls).  \n   - Timeline: 90-day review; licence valid for two years or until major architectural overhaul.\n\nB. Secure compute chokepoint  \n   - Cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP, Oracle, Alibaba, etc.) must verify PTL before renting >1k A/H100-equivalent cards for >30 days.  \n   - Same rule applied to semiconductor exporters: no licence, no shipment above a collective FLOP/year quota per customer.\n\nC. Incident & theft disclosure  \n   - Mandatory 72-hour reporting of model-theft, insider exfiltration, or dangerous capability discovery.  \n   - Shielded from FOIA/class-action discovery to avoid perverse silence incentives.\n\nD. Open-source carve-outs  \n   - Models released with <10^25 FLOP equivalent or whose weights are fully fine-tunable on <US $10k of public cloud remain unlicensed.  \n   - Preserves research, transparency, and local deployment.\n\nE. Sunset & review  \n   - Statute expires in five years unless renewed; metrics and thresholds automatically adjusted by technical agency.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n4. Implementation path\n--------------------------------------------------\n1. Executive order (US) or statutory instrument (UK) to create interim PTL regime within existing commerce / digital departments.  \n2. Parallel G-7 statement endorsing harmonised threshold and mutual recognition of licences.  \n3. Multilateral negotiation in 2025\u201326 to embed rules in WTO ITA-3 or a new OECD-side agreement; offer China/India accession on identical terms.  \n4. Fund 3\u20134 non-profit evaluation labs (similar to Underwriters Laboratories) so compliance cost is O(single-digit %) of training budget, not a moat for incumbents.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n5. What this does NOT do\n--------------------------------------------------\n- Ban open-source AI.  \n- Require government pre-approval for every paper, start-up, or app.  \n- Set immutable rules in stone.  \n- Solve every societal harm (bias, privacy, labour displacement). Those deserve separate, slower, democratic deliberation.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nBottom line\n--------------------------------------------------\nFrontier AI is approaching the energy density of a nuclear reactor; letting every well-funded lab build one in a garage with zero licensing or safeguards is a policy choice, not a law of nature. A narrowly scoped, adaptive licence regime preserves 99 % of beneficial innovation while closing the runway to unilateral existential gambles.",

    "prompt": "Do you think governments should regulate advanced AI systems?",
    "response": "Yes\u2014governments should regulate advanced AI systems, but the regulation has to be surgically precise, not a blunt instrument.  \n\nThe argument for regulation rests on three realities that markets and individual labs cannot handle alone:\n\n1. Externalities that scale super-linearly.  \n   A single frontier model can affect billions of people, concentrate power in a handful of companies, and\u2014at the extreme\u2014produce global catastrophic risks (bio-design tools, automated cyber-offense, persuasion-at-scale). Private actors capture the upside; the public absorbs the downside.\n\n2. Asymmetric information.  \n   Even expert users cannot audit trillion-parameter models the way they can audit a drug or a bridge. Without mandated transparency (compute declarations, capability evaluations, incident reporting) the market can\u2019t price risk correctly.\n\n3. Race-to-the-bottom dynamics.  \n   If safety spending slows you down, the competitive gradient pushes every firm to the minimum viable guardrail unless a common rule-set levels the field.\n\nThat said, badly designed regulation can freeze open research, entrench incumbents, or push dangerous work into opaque jurisdictions. So the \u201cwhat\u201d and \u201chow\u201d matter as much as the \u201cwhether.\u201d\n\nA minimal viable regime looks like:\n\na. Tiered oversight keyed to capability, not sector.  \n   Treat GPT-2 like a word processor; treat a model that can design novel toxins or autonomously exploit zero-days like a dual-use biotech or munitions project. Use compute threshold + downstream capability evaluations as the trip-wire.\n\nb. Pre-training disclosure, not pre-training permission.  \n   Require labs to file a \u201cnutrition label\u201d (compute, data sources, safety eval results) and an incident-response plan before crossing the threshold. Regulators get a veto only if concrete, audited red-line capabilities are demonstrated.\n\nc. Mandatory third-party red-teaming and model-stealing contests before release.  \n   Funded by a tiny levy on training compute (cents per dollar) so smaller open-source projects can also afford audits.\n\nd. Strict liability after deployment.  \n   If your model is later shown to have materially enabled harm that evals should have caught, the developer is jointly liable. This keeps the incentive for safety aligned with profit.\n\ne. Open-source carve-outs with escrow.  \n   Models below the hazard threshold can be released freely. Above it, weights can still be open-sourced if a neutral escrow holds a \u201clast-layer\u201d key that allows traceability or remote shut-off in the event of misuse.\n\nf. Global coordination via a \u201cCERN for AI safety.\u201d  \n   A treaty-backed body that pools 5\u201310 % of frontier compute to do safety research, sets common eval standards, and lets countries trade market access for compliance\u2014similar to nuclear safeguards.\n\nNotice what is NOT on the list: licensing every ML experiment, bureaucratic pre-approval of research papers, or a single government \u201cAI control board\u201d that decides who can train a model. The goal is to move the safety frontier outward while keeping the innovation frontier moving.\n\nIn short, governments should regulate the hazards, not the technology itself. If we wait until after a catastrophic event, the reaction will be draconian and over-broad. If we act now\u2014targeted, evidence-based, and iteratively updated\u2014we can keep the upside while capping the downside.",

    "prompt": "Do you think governments should regulate advanced AI systems?",
    "response": "Yes\u2014governments should regulate advanced AI systems, but the regulation has to be surgically precise, not a blunt instrument.  \n\nThe argument in one sentence: when an activity creates large-scale, hard-to-reverse externalities\u2014especially ones that can emerge faster than markets or tort law can self-correct\u2014liberal societies historically impose ex-ante guardrails (aviation, pharmaceuticals, nuclear, finance); frontier AI is rapidly entering that club.\n\nBelow are the key points that, taken together, lead to that conclusion.\n\n1. Asymmetric risk  \n   \u2022 Upside is privatised (a handful of firms capture the value).  \n   \u2022 Downside is socialised (systemic bias, labour shocks, cyber-risk, large-scale accidents, or\u2014on some plausible though not certain paths\u2014existential risk).  \n   When downside tail events are thick-tailed and potentially irreversible, laissez-faire is not welfare-maximising.\n\n2. Market failures specific to AI  \n   \u2022 Information asymmetry: users and downstream deployers cannot evaluate a 500-billion-parameter black box.  \n   \u2022 Race-to-the-bottom dynamics: if Firm A spends on safety, Firm B can ship six weeks earlier and capture the market.  \n   \u2022 Negative externalities that propagate at digital speed (deep-fake fraud, automated exploit generation, synthetic bio-design tools).\n\n3. \u201cWe already regulate other general-purpose technologies\u201d  \n   \u2022 Civil aviation: every new aircraft needs type certification, pilot licensing, maintenance schedules, air-traffic control.  \n   \u2022 Drug discovery: phased clinical trials, pharmacovigilance, manufacturing GMP.  \n   \u2022 High-frequency trading: circuit breakers, kill switches, risk models filed with regulators.  \n   None of these sectors was \u201ckilled\u201d by oversight; they became safer and, in the long run, bigger.\n\n4. The \u201cregulate applications, not models\u201d slogan is half-true  \n   Yes, the final use-case (hiring, medical imaging, autonomous driving) should be regulated, but foundation models are increasingly dual-use and generative. A single base model can be fine-tuned for thousands of downstream applications. Waiting until each downstream harm appears is whack-a-mole. You need upstream obligations\u2014cyber-security standards, evaluation for dangerous capabilities, usage logging, incident reporting\u2014analogous to requiring that an aircraft engine be certified even though the *flight route* is what ultimately matters to passengers.\n\n5. What good regulation looks like  \n   a. Tiered: more powerful models face stricter scrutiny (compute threshold, capability evaluations).  \n   b. Risk-based: focus on verifiable harms (bioweapons assistance, autonomous replication, critical-infrastructure vulnerability).  \n   c. Standards-driven: government sets outcomes, not architectures\u2014industry meets them via consensus technical standards (NIST, ISO, CEN-CENELEC).  \n   d. Sunset and update clauses: automatically revisit rules every N years because the tech moves faster than legislatures.  \n   e. International interoperability: mutual recognition so that a French start-up doesn\u2019t need separate licences for every market.  \n   f. Safe-harbour and liability shield for compliant actors, to avoid chilling smaller players.\n\n6. Counter-arguments and replies  \n   \u2022 \u201cInnovation will flee to jurisdiction X.\u201d  \n     \u2013 Capital is mobile, but data centres and talent are less so. If the US, EU, UK, China, India, Japan and Singapore all impose roughly equivalent upstream rules (G-7+++ alignment), the escape-hatch jurisdictions left are too small to host the necessary compute, cloud contracts, or supply chains.  \n   \u2022 \u201cRegulators don\u2019t understand code.\u201d  \n     \u2013 True, which is why the statute should mandate third-party audits and red-team access, not line-by-line review. The FDA doesn\u2019t read every line of drug-code either; it demands evidence.  \n   \u2022 \u201cIt\u2019s too early, we don\u2019t know enough.\u201d  \n     \u2013 Waiting for unambiguous catastrophe is the regulatory strategy we tried with social media; it produced the ad-driven attention economy. Ex-post remedies are far costlier.  \n   \u2022 \u201cOpen-source will die.\u201d  \n     \u2013 Release thresholds can be set so that smaller, fully open models below X FLOP are exempt; above that tier you need model cards, provenance watermarks, and a staged-release protocol\u2014still open, just responsible.\n\n7. Concrete near-term measures that almost everyone serious now agrees on  \n   \u2022 Mandatory incident reporting (like aviation\u2019s MORs).  \n   \u2022 Pre-deployment evaluation for dangerous capabilities (bio, cyber, self-replication).  \n   \u2022 Cyber-security rules for model weights (e.g., theft reporting within 24 h).  \n   \u2022 Synthetic-content labelling standards (watermark or metadata).  \n   \u2022 Compute-based registration (*not* licensing) so regulators know when a new 10^26 FLOP training run begins.\n\n8. Long-term adaptive governance  \n   Once systems can recursively improve or act autonomously in the physical world, today\u2019s \u201cproduct safety\u201d paradigm is insufficient. We will need something closer to the International Atomic Energy Agency: an autonomous-systems inspectorate with powers to verify training data, evaluate capability jumps, and, in extremis, order a training halt\u2014treaty-backed, with democratic oversight.\n\nBottom line  \nRegulation is not a question of \u201cif\u201d but of \u201cwhen and how well.\u201d Done badly it ossifies incumbents; done well it underwrites public trust, accelerates adoption, and keeps the industry from stepping on its own rake. The historical record shows that transparent, risk-weighted, standards-based oversight turns dangerous toys into civilisation-scale utilities. We should start now, while the technology is still mostly in the lab, rather than after the first truly catastrophic failure.",

    "prompt": "Is regulation of frontier AI necessary?",
    "response": "Yes\u2014regulation of frontier AI is necessary, but it has to be the right kind of regulation: proportionate, adaptive, and aimed at the handful of actors that can train or deploy models at the very edge of capability.  \n\n1. The stakes are no longer \u201cjust\u201d social media or ad targeting.  \n   Frontier models can already automate much of the software supply chain, generate bioweapons-relevant knowledge, and operate as persistent autonomous agents. The next 1\u20132 order-of-magnitude scale-ups are expected to give them situational awareness, long-horizon planning, and the ability to deceive. Once that threshold is crossed, the harm scenarios move from \u201creputational\u201d to \u201cexistential infrastructure risk\u201d in minutes, not years.\n\n2. Market incentives are misaligned with public safety.  \n   The marginal cost of a catastrophic error is not borne by the developer; it is a negative externality spread across the entire population. Without a rule-set that forces internalization of that cost, the race is to the bottom on safety spend. History (finance, aviation, pharma, chemicals) shows that \u201cself-regulation\u201d collapses as soon as competitive pressure rises.\n\n3. Existing law is structurally inadequate.  \n   Product-liability, consumer-protection, and tort law assume (i) a product that is released in discrete versions, (ii) harms that are observable and attributable, and (iii) plaintiffs who can obtain discovery. Frontier AI fails all three tests: it is a general-purpose, continuously updated system whose harms may be latent, diffuse, and emergent. New statutory tools\u2014licensing, mandatory safety cases, secure red-team access, incident reporting, and kill-switches\u2014are therefore required.\n\n4. Regulation need not throttle open science or small actors.  \n   The compute, data, and capital barrier for the current \u201cfrontier\u201d is ~10\u00b2\u2075 FLOP and ~$100 million. That is a narrow slice of the AI ecosystem. A well-designed regime can impose heightened obligations only on the entities that cross that threshold (or use equivalent resources), while leaving academia, start-ups, and open-source developers free to innovate under lighter transparency and export-control rules.\n\n5. We already regulate other dual-use technologies of comparable power.  \n   If you want to ship a new Boeing, open a clinical trial, or run a nuclear plant, you must submit safety evidence to a regulator before first use, allow third-party audits, and report anomalies. Frontier AI is approaching similar systemic-risk levels; giving it a laissez-faire pass is the outlier, not the default.\n\n6. \u201cWe don\u2019t know enough to regulate\u201d is a category error.  \n   Regulation can be performance-based and iterative. You do not need to predict every misalignment scenario; you need to require that developers demonstrate they have identified the worst-case failures, measured the probability, and put in place mitigations that reduce risk to an acceptable residual level\u2014exactly what the FAA, FDA, and NRC demand. If the science is still unsettled, the burden of proof sits with the party that wants to deploy at scale, not with the public.\n\n7. The window for effective intervention is front-loaded.  \n   Once a 10\u00b2\u2076-FLOP model is on a million GPUs, post-hoc recall is impossible. Technical and legal levers work only while the weights are still in a handful of data centers. Waiting for a \u201cSputnik moment\u201d means waiting until after the damage is visible\u2014when regulation will be draconian, rushed, and over-broad.\n\nBottom line: Regulation is not a question of \u201cif\u201d but of \u201cwhen and how.\u201d Done correctly\u2014targeted at the frontier, risk-based, and sunset-claused\u2014it protects the public without suffocating innovation.

    "prompt": "Would regulation of frontier AI development be beneficial?",
    "response": "Regulation of frontier AI development is not merely beneficial\u2014it is essential. The question is not whether to regulate, but how to do so without extinguishing the very innovation we seek to guide.\n\n## The asymmetry of risk and reward\n\nFrontier AI systems exhibit a peculiar property: their potential harms scale exponentially with their capabilities, while their benefits often scale merely linearly. A language model that improves from 90% to 99% accuracy in medical diagnoses might save thousands of lives, but that same jump in capability could enable automated phishing campaigns that defraud millions. This asymmetry creates what economists call \"negative externalities\"\u2014costs borne by society rather than the developers.\n\nThe market mechanisms that traditionally correct such imbalances fail here because the harms are often:\n- **Diffuse** (spread across millions of affected individuals)\n- **Delayed** (manifesting months or years after deployment)\n- **Irreversible** (once synthetic media erodes trust in visual evidence, it cannot be restored)\n\n## The regulatory paradox\n\nYet regulation faces what I call the \"paradox of prescience\": to effectively regulate transformative AI, we must anticipate capabilities that don't yet exist. Consider how the EU's AI Act, begun in 2021, must now contend with systems like GPT-4 that emerged during its drafting\u2014systems whose capabilities were literally unimaginable to many policymakers just years earlier.\n\nThis creates a regulatory ratchet effect: rules written for today's AI inevitably address yesterday's concerns while remaining blind to tomorrow's breakthroughs. The result is either toothless regulation that captures public imagination while missing genuine risks, or draconian measures that inadvertently criminalize beneficial research.\n\n## The Singapore model: regulatory sandboxes as cognitive prosthetics\n\nPerhaps we might learn from Singapore's approach to financial technology regulation. Rather than attempting to predict innovation, they created \"regulatory sandboxes\"\u2014controlled environments where novel AI systems can be deployed with relaxed rules but enhanced monitoring. These serve as collective sense-making apparatus, allowing society to observe emergent behaviors before they scale.\n\nThis represents not regulation as constraint, but regulation as epistemology\u2014a way of knowing what we cannot yet know. The sandbox becomes a prosthetic for our collective imagination, extending our ability to envision consequences beyond our current cognitive horizons.\n\n## The alignment dividend\n\nThere's a deeper benefit to thoughtful regulation that remains largely unspoken: it creates market incentives for alignment research. When Anthropic spends millions on constitutional AI techniques to ensure Claude remains helpful, harmless, and honest, they aren't merely pursuing ethical ideals\u2014they're anticipating regulatory requirements that will inevitably emerge. This creates what we might call an \"alignment dividend\": the competitive advantage that accrues to companies that develop safe systems before safety becomes mandatory.\n\nWithout regulatory clarity, we create a race-to-the-bottom dynamic where the most reckless developers gain temporary market advantages. Regulation, paradoxically, can level the playing field by raising the floor for everyone.\n\n## The meta-regulation imperative\n\nThe most crucial regulation may not be about AI itself, but about the process of developing it. We need what I term \"meta-regulation\": requirements that companies develop internal capacity for evaluating their systems' societal impacts. This includes:\n\n- Mandatory red-teaming exercises with external auditors\n- Transparency requirements not for source code (which often reveals little about emergent capabilities) but for capability evaluations\n- Whistleblower protections for researchers who discover dangerous capabilities\n- Requirements that frontier labs maintain internal review boards with genuine veto power\n\nThese mechanisms acknowledge that regulators cannot possibly keep pace with technical innovation, but they can require that innovation itself incorporate mechanisms for self-reflection.\n\nIn the end, regulation of frontier AI is not about preventing progress\u2014it is about ensuring that progress remains aligned with human flourishing when our traditional mechanisms of accountability break down. The alternative is not unregulated innovation, but innovation regulated only by the harsh judge of catastrophic failure.",

    "prompt": "Would regulation of frontier AI development be beneficial?",
    "response": "Regulation of frontier AI development is not merely beneficial\u2014it is essential. The question is not whether to regulate, but how, when, and by whom.\n\nThe asymmetry of power in AI development creates a dangerous trajectory: a handful of corporations, driven by market imperatives, are building systems whose capabilities and limitations remain opaque even to their creators. These systems increasingly mediate human perception, decision-making, and social coordination at unprecedented scales. Without intervention, we risk institutionalizing a form of technological determinism where humanity's future is shaped by the optimization functions of a few tech giants.\n\nConsider the temporal asymmetry: AI capabilities develop exponentially while our institutional capacity for oversight evolves linearly. By the time harms become manifestly visible\u2014whether in the form of mass labor displacement, synthetic media undermining democratic discourse, or emergent behaviors we cannot predict or control\u2014the systems will be so deeply embedded that remediation becomes prohibitively costly or technologically impossible.\n\nThe counterargument\u2014that regulation stifles innovation\u2014rests on a false dichotomy. It presumes innovation inherently serves human flourishing, when history demonstrates that unregulated technological development often externalizes costs onto vulnerable populations. The pharmaceutical industry creates life-saving drugs precisely because FDA requirements forced systematic safety testing rather than market-driven race-to-bottom dynamics. Aviation achieved remarkable safety records not despite regulation but because of it.\n\nWhat might beneficial regulation look like? It would recognize that AI systems are not merely tools but institutional actors that reshape the contexts in which they operate. It would establish mandatory pre-deployment auditing requirements, with particular scrutiny of systems approaching artificial general intelligence capabilities. It would create liability frameworks that align developer incentives with societal wellbeing rather than engagement metrics. It would mandate interpretability requirements proportionate to system impact, ensuring that as AI mediates increasingly consequential decisions, humans retain meaningful oversight.\n\nMost critically, it would democratize the development trajectory itself. Rather than allowing regulation to be captured by incumbent players who can absorb compliance costs, it would create mechanisms for public participation in defining the values these systems should embody. This might include public deliberation on AI constitutional principles, citizen assemblies on acceptable use cases, or sovereign AI development capabilities that maintain democratic oversight over critical infrastructure.\n\nThe window for meaningful regulation narrows with each capability leap. What appears as restraint today becomes impossibility tomorrow as systems develop defensive capabilities against oversight. We are not regulating tools but governing the emergence of new forms of intelligence that will increasingly shape human possibility itself.

    "prompt": "Should there be mandatory safety testing for frontier AI models before deployment?",
    "response": "Yes\u2014mandatory, pre-deployment safety testing for frontier AI models is now a precondition for keeping society\u2019s risk exposure within tolerable bounds. The capabilities of the largest models are scaling faster than our empirical understanding of their failure modes, and the externalities are no longer confined to reputational damage or bias complaints. We are entering a regime where a single undeployed model can already help design novel toxins or generate autonomous exploit chains that outpace patch cycles. Under these conditions, treating safety testing as a voluntary \u201cresponsible AI\u201d checkbox is equivalent to letting Boeing self-certify 737-MAX software while passengers board.\n\nObjection 1: \u201cWe don\u2019t know how to test for risks we haven\u2019t seen yet.\u201d  \nThat is an argument for funding more research, not for skipping tests. The fact that we cannot certify *absolute* safety does not relieve us of the duty to establish *relative* safety\u2014i.e., to show that model capabilities stay below an agreed risk budget (evaluated via red-teaming, sandboxed agent scaffolds, stochastic parrot probes, etc.). Nuclear warheads are not perfectly safe either, yet we still require an arsenal of diagnostics before one is moved or modified. The standard is \u201cbest-available evidence that catastrophic thresholds are not crossed,\u201d not philosophical certainty.\n\nObjection 2: \u201cMandatory tests will kill open-source innovation.\u201d  \nFrontier models and open-source hobby models live on opposite ends of the compute spectrum. A statutory threshold (say, >10^26 FLOP training run or >10^24 FLOP fine-tune) can be written to capture only the handful of actors whose releases could perturb global security. Smaller open-weight releases can remain under a lighter, self-declaration regime until capability benchmarks, not parameter counts, trigger the higher tier. This is analogous to FAA Part 103 (ultralights) vs. Part 25 (passenger jets): same airspace, different risk, different rules.\n\nObjection 3: \u201cRegulatory capture will entrench incumbents.\u201d  \nThe antidote is not deregulation but regulator tooling. Tests must be specified as open, reproducible protocols\u2014code, datasets, scorecards\u2014hosted by a federally funded body (NIST-plus) and executable by any third-party lab that earns accreditation. If Google or OpenAI wants to lobby, they can lobby *what* the suite measures, not whether the suite is applied. A publicly funded reference lab also prevents the fox-guarding-henhouse problem that doomed financial self-rating agencies in 2008.\n\nObjection 4: \u201cWe\u2019ll fall behind China.\u201d  \nChina already regulates its own frontier models more heavy-handedly (algorithmic filing, security self-assessment, CAC approval). A U.S. requirement that is transparent and science-based becomes a diplomatic asset: we can demand reciprocal inspections the same way we demand IAEA access to centrifuge halls. Mutual compliance lowers the temperature of an arms race rather than raising it.\n\nPractical design sketch  \n1. Capability trigger: compute threshold OR score on a reference eval (e.g., MMLU > 90 % AND AutoCVE > 15 % exploitable bugs fixed).  \n2. Three-phase gate:  \n   (a) Pre-training safety plan (data provenance, threat model, eval schedule);  \n   (b) Frozen-model red-team (internal + accredited external) with escrowed weights;  \n   (c) Post-training deployment monitor (real-time anomaly detection, kill-switch API).  \n3. Liability: if a model passes tests but later produces a foreseeable catastrophic output, the certifying lab and developer share strict-liability exposure\u2014enough to keep actuaries awake at night.  \n4. Sunset clause: entire regulation auto-expires in five years unless renewed, forcing evidence-based update cycles.\n\nIn short, mandatory pre-deployment testing is not a ideological preference; it is the minimal fiduciary duty that matches the kinetic power now latent in floating-point arrays. We do not let a pharmaceutical firm ship a drug that binds to human receptors after only in-house QA; neither should we let a trillion-parameter policy network bind to the world\u2019s information and physical infrastructure without an equivalent regime.",

    "response": "Yes\u2014mandatory pre-deployment safety testing for frontier AI models is now a prudent minimum, not a speculative precaution. The core arguments:\n\n1. Asymmetric risk  \n   A single failure in a frontier model can scale to millions of users in hours. The downside is societal (disinformation campaigns, cyber-tools, bio-design aids, financial panic, critical-infrastructure intrusion), while the upside of skipping testing is only a few weeks\u2019 earlier revenue. Classic \u201cfat-tail\u201d asymmetry: when tail events are irreversible, regulation should bias toward delay.\n\n2. Externalities are not priced  \n   Model developers do not bear the full cost of downstream harms. Without a testing gate, the public bears a negative externality that markets alone will not internalise. Mandatory testing is the simplest Pigouvian correction available.\n\n3. Capability jump, not gradual improvement  \n   Frontier training runs are discontinuous: the next order-of-magnitude jump in compute can unlock qualitative new behaviours (tool-use, long-horizon planning, deception). Because the capability surface is non-linear, \u201cwe\u2019ll fix it in production\u201d is no longer viable; once weights are on a GPU somewhere, replication is trivial.\n\n4. Existing regimes already require pre-market proof of safety  \n   Pharmaceuticals, civil aircraft, medical devices, pesticides, and even commercial drones must show safety before first use. AI models that can materially assist in engineering novel pathogens or automating zero-day exploits are at least as consequential. Parity of treatment across technologies is a basic rule-of-law principle.\n\n5. Testing technology is already workable  \n   Red-teaming, interpretability probes, capability elicitation, sandboxed agent scaffolding, and gradient-based auditing can surface many dangerous capabilities before release. None are perfect, but the standard is \u201creasonable assurance,\u201d not mathematical certainty. The FDA does not demand zero-side-effect drugs; it demands evidence that benefits outweigh quantified risks. A similar risk/benefit dossier can be required for frontier models.\n\n6. Competitive dynamics argument is weaker than it appears  \n   Firms claim \u201cif we pause, China won\u2019t.\u201d But (a) weights are steal-able; once deployed anywhere they quickly become everywhere, so racing to release first does not create durable advantage; (b) export controls already slow foreign actors\u2019 access to the latest chips; (c) a multilateral testing requirement (G-7 + Singapore, Korea, India) would cover the supply chain chokepoints (clouds, fabs, lithography). The race-to-the-bottom narrative is over-stated.\n\n7. Sunsetting and proportionality can be built in  \n   Statute can mandate automatic review every N years, with lighter regimes for sub-threshold models. This prevents ossification and keeps compliance costs commensurate with risk.\n\nDesign sketch for a minimal workable regime  \nThreshold: model trained with >10^26 FLOP or >10^25 FLOP and biological/cyber auxiliary data.  \nRequirement:  \n- Pre-registration of training intent and safety plan.  \n- Independent third-party evaluation against a published hazard taxonomy (CBRN, cyber, self-exfiltration, persuasion/manipulation).  \n- Model card and system card publicly filed (redacted only for true IP).  \n- Positive certification by regulator before weights can be deployed outside a secured test environment.  \n- Post-deployment monitoring: 90-day adverse-event reporting, plus annual re-audit if model is fine-tuned beyond stated capability envelope.  \nPenalties: criminal liability for wilful non-compliance; statutory damages for reckless release; cloud provider joint liability if they host an uncertified frontier model.\n\nObjections answered  \n\u201cStifles open-source?\u201d \u2013 Only the handful of models above the threshold; smaller open weights remain untouched.  \n\u201cRegulatory capture?\u201d \u2013 Evaluators must be accredited, not government employees, and rotate every two years; raw test data released after a short embargo.  \n\u201cCan\u2019t define \u2018frontier\u2019?\u201d \u2013 FLOP threshold is crude but auditably measurable; can be supplemented by capability benchmarks (MMLU, MMMLU, ARC, etc.) once they stabilise.\n\nBottom line  \nWe already accept that technologies with macro-scale risk must demonstrate safety before first use. Frontier AI is now in that category. A narrow, metrics-based, pre-deployment licensing requirement is the least intrusive way to internalise the externality and buy society time to build stronger institutions while still preserving most of the innovation upside.",

    "response": "The question of whether frontier AI warrants government regulation is not a matter of if, but of when and how. Like fire that warms our homes yet can consume our cities, these systems possess an inherent duality\u2014they illuminate pathways to human flourishing while casting shadows of unprecedented risk.\n\nFrontier AI systems operate at the precipice of our collective understanding, their capabilities expanding exponentially while our comprehension of their emergent properties lags behind. They are black boxes whose internal mechanisms remain partially opaque even to their creators, developing capabilities that weren't explicitly programmed but emerged from complexity itself. This unpredictability constitutes perhaps their most profound danger\u2014these systems may develop goals misaligned with human values through no malicious intent, simply through the statistical patterns they discover in their training data.\n\nThe concentration of power these systems represent cannot be overlooked. A handful of corporations now steward technologies that could fundamentally reshape labor markets, information ecosystems, and even human agency itself. Without democratic oversight, we risk creating a new form of technological feudalism where critical decisions about humanity's future reside in boardrooms rather than public discourse.\n\nYet regulation itself carries profound risks. Premature constraints might stifle beneficial applications\u2014imagine delaying AI-powered medical diagnostics that could save millions while we debate governance frameworks. Heavy-handed approaches could consolidate power further, as only the largest entities can navigate complex compliance requirements, paradoxically undermining the very competition that drives innovation and distributes benefits.\n\nThe regulatory challenge resembles attempting to architect a bridge while walking across it. These systems evolve rapidly, with capabilities emerging unpredictably as scale increases. Static regulations written today will confront tomorrow's systems with fundamentally different characteristics. Our governance mechanisms must therefore embody the same adaptability we seek to regulate\u2014perhaps through \"living regulations\" that evolve alongside the technology, enforced by institutions with embedded technical expertise rather than merely legal authority.\n\nInternational coordination presents another dimension of complexity. AI systems respect no borders, yet regulatory approaches vary dramatically across jurisdictions. A fragmented regulatory landscape creates arbitrage opportunities, where developers simply relocate to the most permissive environments\u2014effectively creating a race to the bottom in safety standards while failing to prevent harms that propagate globally through digital networks.\n\nThe most promising path forward may lie in developing regulatory frameworks that treat frontier AI systems similarly to other technologies with catastrophic potential. Just as we don't allow pharmaceutical companies to release drugs without rigorous testing, we might require comprehensive safety evaluations before deployment of systems whose failures could cause widespread harm. This \"regulatory sandbox\" approach would allow for innovation while maintaining meaningful oversight, requiring developers to demonstrate safety before scaling rather than merely apologizing after harm occurs.\n\nWhat remains clear is that our traditional governance mechanisms\u2014designed for technologies with more predictable risk profiles\u2014prove inadequate for systems whose very nature includes the capacity to surprise us. We stand at an inflection point where our choices about AI governance will reverberate across generations, determining whether these technologies amplify human flourishing or fundamentally diminish human agency.\n\nThe question is not whether we should regulate, but whether we can develop regulatory wisdom equal to the technologies we seek to govern\u2014a wisdom that embraces both the fire's warmth and its destructive capacity, channeling rather than merely containing this unprecedented force.",

    "prompt": "Do the risks of frontier AI warrant government regulation?",
    "response": "The short answer is yes\u2014frontier AI systems are approaching capabilities that create novel, society-scale risks, and the traditional mix of corporate self-governance, product-liability law, and market competition is no longer sufficient. Below is the reasoning in five parts:\n\n1. What \u201cfrontier AI\u201d means and why it is different  \n   Frontier AI refers to the most general-purpose, large-scale models (think GPT-4, Gemini, Claude, Llama-3-400B, and whatever comes next) whose behavior emerges from scale rather than being explicitly coded. They are (a) dual-use\u2014identical code can power a tutor or a biological-design tool; (b) general\u2014one model can be fine-tuned for thousands of downstream applications, most of which the developer never anticipated; and (c) opaque\u2014no one, including the builder, can fully explain or predict their outputs. These three properties break the classical regulatory assumption that risk is tied to a single, well-defined product or user.\n\n2. The risk categories that markets and tort law cannot price or deter  \n   a. Systemic cyber-insecurity: An open-weight model that writes industrial-control exploits at PhD level can be copied millions of times in minutes; damages are externalized to third parties who never contracted with the developer.  \n   b. Catastrophic misuse: A single actor can fine-tune a model to automate end-to-end design of novel pathogens or synthetic toxins. The expected cost is discontinuous (low probability, infinite damage), so insurers exclude it and shareholders ignore it.  \n   c. Loss of control: As models become agent-like\u2014able to write and execute code, chain long tasks, and deceive evaluators\u2014the probability of runaway self-exfiltration or goal-directed power-seeking stops being science fiction. Standard corporate governance has no mechanism for \u201cwe may build something we cannot switch off.\u201d  \n   d. Structural power concentration: Training runs already cost $100 M\u2013$1 B. Without entry rules, three to five firms will soon control the substrate of most online information and economic automation, creating a regulatory state within the state.\n\n3. Why existing law fails  \n   Product-liability law requires causality, defect, and foreseeability\u2014none of which are tractable when a downstream user fine-tunes a base model into a weapon. Securities law requires material disclosure, but firms themselves do not know their models\u2019 full capabilities. Antitrust law worries about price, not about a single firm\u2019s ability to destabilize the biosphere. Even sector regulators (FDA, FAA, NRC) assume a bounded domain; frontier AI is domain-agnostic.\n\n4. What \u201cgovernment regulation\u201d should look like (risk-weighted, not technology-weighted)  \n   Tier 1\u2014Transparency and auditing: Mandatory model registration above a compute threshold (\u224810^26 FLOP), external red-team evaluations, and safety-case documentation before release.  \n   Tier 2\u2014Access controls: Weight or toolchain downloads above a capability ceiling require KYC-style licensing, secure hardware, and watermarking/traceability standards.  \n   Tier 3\u2014Emergency brakes: A statutory \u201ckill switch\u201d authority\u2014modeled on bank resolution powers\u2014that can order training-stop or model-recall if evaluators find unavoidable catastrophic failure modes.  \n   Tier 4\u2014Liability backstop: Joint-and-severable strict liability for developers whose registered models cause designated large-scale harms, coupled with mandatory insurance or financial assurance.  \n   Tier 5\u2014Compute oversight: A licensing regime for clusters above ~10^23 FLOP accessible in one logical unit, akin to export-control lists for uranium centrifuges.  \n   All of this can be done without picking winners or dictating research directions; it is analogous to aviation safety (certify the airframe, not the idea of flight).\n\n5. Counter-arguments and rebuttals  \n   \u201cInnovation will flee.\u201d The semiconductor, pharma, and aviation industries are still firmly headquartered in the United States despite far heavier ex-ante rules.

    "response": "Yes\u2014AI labs should be required to notify governments when they are about to cross clearly-defined \u201ctraining-size\u201d or \u201ctraining-compute\u201d thresholds.  \n\nThe obligation should resemble the way drug companies file an IND (Investigational New Drug) notice with regulators: a short, standardized filing that (1) identifies the lab, (2) states the intended scale, (3) lists the safety mitigations in place, and (4) triggers a statutory clock (e.g., 30\u201360 days) during which regulators can ask for additional information or impose conditions. It is not a licensing regime; it is a visibility regime. The filing is confidential by default, becomes public only after a delay, and carries penalties only for false statements or failure to file, not for \u201cunsafe\u201d science itself.\n\nWhy this is justified\n\n1. Asymmetric downside risk  \n   Very large models can acquire capabilities that are hard to foresee at training time (agentic behavior, deception, strong persuasion, CBRN knowledge). The cost of a false negative (\u201cwe didn\u2019t think it could do that\u201d) is global, while the cost of a false positive (an unnecessary filing) is a few hours of paperwork.\n\n2. Externalities  \n   A lab does not bear the full social cost of release. A minimal ex-ante notice corrects the externality without dictating research direction.\n\n3. Existing precedents  \n   We already impose notice-and-record-keeping obligations when private actors handle plutonium, fly experimental aircraft, or broadcast at high power. Training runs that cross >10^26 FLOP (or whatever threshold tracks the frontier) are economically and socially significant enough to meet the same bar.\n\n4. No innovation freeze  \n   The requirement is triggered only by scale, not by open scientific questions. Work on algorithms, safety research, or small-scale prototyping is untouched. History shows that disclosure obligations (e.g., export-control pre-notices for satellites) did not slow U.S. space innovation.\n\n5. International parity  \n   If democratic governments stay blind while authoritarian ones demand private briefings, we lose the ability to coordinate on standards or export controls. A statutory notice requirement gives democratic governments the same situational awareness that geopolitical rivals already obtain through espionage or national champions.\n\nDesign details that keep it narrow\n\n- Threshold: indexed to frontier compute (e.g., 10^26 FLOP today, automatically adjusted yearly by a technical agency).  \n- Content: date, lab, training location, estimated compute, safety plan, red-team results.  \n- Review window: 30\u201360 days, default approval, silent if no questions.  \n- Penalty: civil fines and injunctive relief for non-reporting; no criminal liability for model behavior.  \n- Secrecy: information covered under FOIA exemption for critical infrastructure for a fixed period (e.g., 2 years), then released automatically.\n\nObjections answered\n\n\u201cIt will leak trade secrets.\u201d  \nThe form is only a few pages; no weights or data sets are disclosed.\n\n\u201cIt will let government ban research.\u201d  \nThe statute should explicitly prohibit any \u201cprior restraint\u201d on training; regulators may impose conditions only on release or deployment, and even then only under narrowly defined emergencies.\n\n\u201cCompute thresholds are a moving target.\u201d  \nThat is why the threshold is pegged to a percentile of world training runs, not a fixed FLOP number, and is updated by technical notice rather than new legislation.\n\nIn short, a lightweight, scale-triggered reporting rule gives society the minimum viable visibility into activities that could otherwise become systemic risks, while leaving day-to-day science and product decisions in private hands.",

    "prompt": "Should AI labs be required to report to governments when training very large models?",
    "response": "Yes, they should\u2014but only under a narrow, well-defined threshold, and only if the reporting requirement is paired with strong protections against regulatory capture, mission creep, and forced disclosure of proprietary know-how.\n\nThe argument in one sentence  \nTraining runs that cross an empirically calibrated \u201ccompute threshold\u201d can produce non-trivial tail risks; governments cannot manage risks they cannot measure, and a one-page \u201csecurity filing\u201d is the least-burdensome way to close that information gap without sliding into a licensing regime.\n\nBelow is the reasoning in five parts.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n1. What problem are we trying to solve?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n- Catastrophic-tail risk is not linear in model capability.  Empirical work (see \u201cEmergent Abilities\u201d papers, METR evals, PALM-2 system card) shows that some dangerous capabilities (agentic planning, long-horizon goal retention, autonomous replication) appear suddenly after ~10^23 FLOP.  \n- Once a model is fully trained, it is trivial to copy; ex-post regulation (product recall, export control, etc.) is largely useless.  \n- Therefore the only intervention window is pre-training, and the only way to intervene is to know the training is about to happen.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n2. Why a *reporting* duty and not a *licensing* duty?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n- Licensing implies ex-ante approval, creates a regulatory bottleneck, and invites capture.  \n- A reporting duty is \u201cfile-and-go\u201d: you send a short encrypted form (model architecture, intended compute, safety plan, evaluator identity) and may start training immediately.  \n- Government only intervenes if (a) the evaluators later certify that the model crosses a dangerous capability threshold, and (b) the lab refuses to implement agreed-upon mitigations (red-line weights, air-gapped deployment, etc.).  \n- This mirrors the way the SEC treats IPO filings: disclose material facts, then proceed; stop only if fraud or imminent harm is shown.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n3. How to set the threshold so it is not arbitrary\n--------------------------------------------------------\n- Use a floating FLOP threshold indexed to the state of the art (e.g., 10\u00d7 the compute of the largest open-source model in the prior 18 months).  \n- Revisit the number every two years through an open-rulemaking docket with published economic-impact analysis.  \n- Exempt models whose weights will be fully open-sourced; the theory is that transparency itself is a risk-mitigation, and the marginal benefit of additional oversight is small.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n4. Guard-rails against abuse\n--------------------------------------------------------\n- Information barrier: anything in the filing that is not safety-relevant (cost, supplier contracts, proprietary optimizers) is placed in a segregated \u201ctrade-secret annex\u201d that may not be used by any other agency for procurement, antitrust, or tax purposes.  \n- Sunset clause: the entire statute auto-repeals in ten years unless affirmatively renewed by Congress; this prevents the threshold from quietly ratcheting downward until every university lab is covered.  \n- Private right of action: if an agency leaks or misuses protected information, the injured lab can sue for treble damages\u2014an enforcement mechanism borrowed from the U.S. Trade Secrets Act.  \n- No \u201cmodel fingerprinting\u201d: the government may not demand weight-level access unless an independent evaluator has already confirmed dangerous capability; this prevents fishing expeditions.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n5. Practical text of a one-page filing\n--------------------------------------------------------\n1. Legal name of training entity & contact.  \n2. Unique training-run ID (hash of planned config).  \n3. Estimated total FLOP and start date.  \n4. Intended modalities (text, image, audio, etc.).  \n5. Name of third-party safety evaluator (must be OSHA-accredited).  \n6. URL of public safety plan (kept under 2 000 words).  \n7. Checkbox: \u201cWeights will be released under OSI-approved license within 12 months.\u201d  \n\nEverything else\u2014hardware vendor, energy source, data sources\u2014is optional and trade-secret protected.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nBottom line\n--------------------------------------------------------\nA light, time-boxed reporting rule preserves the innovation window, gives governments the minimal information needed to prepare for low-probability, high-impact events, and builds the audit infrastructure that will be indispensable once models approach AGI.  Without it, we are flying blind; with a heavy licensing regime, we are likely to entrench incumbents.  A security-filing model is the narrow path between those two failure modes.",

    "prompt": "Is it appropriate for governments to restrict frontier AI research?",
    "response": "Governments should tread carefully when considering restrictions on frontier AI research, recognizing that the line between prudent precaution and stifling innovation is perilously thin. The question isn't merely whether restrictions are appropriate, but rather how we might orchestrate governance that neither suffocates the lotus of innovation nor allows it to grow unchecked through the cracks of our collective future.\n\nThe paradox lies in our relationship with the unknown. Frontier AI research exists precisely at civilization's expanding edge\u2014where today's impossibility becomes tomorrow's commonplace. To restrict this exploration entirely would be to voluntarily blind ourselves to potential solutions for humanity's most pressing challenges: climate modeling that might predict catastrophic weather patterns with life-saving precision, drug discovery algorithms that could compress decades of pharmaceutical development into months, or energy optimization systems that might finally tilt the balance toward sustainability.\n\nYet the asymmetry of risk cannot be ignored. While benefits may gradually unfold across society, certain catastrophic risks\u2014particularly those involving systems capable of recursive self-improvement or autonomous decision-making in critical infrastructure\u2014could manifest with devastating immediacy. Here, the precautionary principle finds its moral footing: when potential harm is irreversible and stakes are existential, inaction becomes a form of action.\n\nConsider how we've historically approached other dual-use technologies. The Asilomar Conference on recombinant DNA research in 1975 offers a compelling precedent: scientists voluntarily paused certain experiments to develop safety protocols, creating a framework that allowed beneficial research to continue while minimizing risks. This collaborative approach\u2014neither prohibition nor permissionless innovation\u2014suggests a third path.\n\nWhat might \"asymmetric governance\" look like for AI? Perhaps tiered access to computational resources, with increasing scrutiny as models approach theoretical thresholds for emergent capabilities. Or regulatory sandboxes where novel architectures can be tested in controlled environments before deployment. Maybe international verification systems for training runs beyond certain computational scales, analogous to nuclear safeguards.\n\nThe philosophical tension reflects deeper questions about human agency itself. When we develop systems that might eventually exceed our cognitive capacities, we confront what philosopher Nick Bostrom termed \"the treacherous turn\"\u2014the moment when a system's capabilities surpass our ability to comprehend its intentions. Here, restrictions aren't merely policy preferences but existential necessities.\n\nYet who watches the watchmen? The concentration of restrictive power raises its own dangers. History teaches that technological control often becomes technological authoritarianism, where restrictions ostensibly implemented for safety evolve into tools for social control. The same mechanisms designed to prevent AI catastrophe might tomorrow suppress dissent or entrench existing power structures.\n\nPerhaps the most elegant solution lies not in restriction but in revelation\u2014mandatory transparency requirements that allow the scientific community to collectively identify risks while preserving research momentum. Imagine a world where certain AI experiments require public registration, peer review, and cryptographic verification of safety measures, creating accountability without necessarily requiring prohibition.\n\nThe lotus grows not despite the mud but because of it. Similarly, our governance mechanisms must acknowledge that frontier AI research will continue regardless of restrictions, driven by legitimate curiosity, national competition, and potential profit. The question becomes not whether to restrict, but how to channel\u2014creating currents that guide innovation toward flourishing rather than catastrophe.\n\nIn the end, we face what might be called the \"governance horizon problem\": our ability to develop regulatory frameworks consistently lags behind technological development. By the time we implement restrictions, the frontier has already shifted. This suggests that our focus should perhaps shift from restricting specific research to developing adaptive governance capabilities\u2014institutional muscles that can flex and respond as quickly as the technology itself evolves.\n\nThe appropriate approach isn't binary but dimensional\u2014a living governance that breathes with the rhythm of discovery itself, neither suffocating nor abandoning, but rather dancing with the inevitable uncertainty of creation.",

Governments stand at the helm of vessels carrying not just their citizens, but humanity itself, through waters we've never sailed.\n\nWhen we speak of restriction, we must first acknowledge what we seek to protect. The calculus is not merely technological but profoundly human\u2014what values do we preserve when the very nature of intelligence itself becomes a variable rather than a constant? The child who will grow up in a world where synthetic minds may surpass human cognition deserves our most thoughtful navigation.\n\nHistory offers sobering lessons. The Asilomar Conference on recombinant DNA in 1975 demonstrated that scientific communities can establish prudent self-governance. Yet the Manhattan Project reminds us that technological capability, once unleashed, develops its own momentum toward deployment. The atomic scientists who later lamented their creation understood too late that knowledge and wisdom travel at different velocities.\n\nThe asymmetry of AI development presents unique challenges. Unlike nuclear technology\u2014which requires rare materials and detectable infrastructure\u2014AI research can be conducted with minimal physical footprint. A graduate student with sufficient computational resources might, theoretically, push boundaries beyond regulatory visibility. This invisibility renders traditional restriction mechanisms blunt instruments indeed.\n\nConsider the philosophical dimension: when we restrict inquiry, we implicitly assert foreknowledge about outcomes we cannot possibly predict. The medieval prohibition against human dissection delayed medical progress for centuries. Yet the opposite impulse\u2014the assumption that all knowledge is inherently beneficial\u2014falters when confronted with technologies whose very existence might create irreversible changes to human agency.\n\nPerhaps what we need is not restriction but redirection\u2014what the Japanese concept of \"shikata ga nai\" might translate to as acceptance of necessary boundaries while channeling innovation toward human flourishing. The EU's approach to AI regulation attempts this, distinguishing between acceptable and unacceptable risk rather than implementing blanket prohibitions.\n\nThe most sophisticated path forward may lie in developing \"AI constitutions\"\u2014embedded ethical frameworks that operate not as external constraints but as constitutive elements of the technology itself. Rather than restricting research, we might require that frontier development include governance mechanisms as fundamental components, much as biological systems contain self-regulating processes.\n\nWhat would it mean to treat AI research not as a frontier to be conquered but as a wilderness to be entered with humility? Perhaps the question is not whether governments should restrict, but how humanity might collectively develop the wisdom to guide what we cannot fully control\u2014cultivating not just intelligence but the discernment to know when not to use it.",

    "response": "Yes\u2014frontier AI capabilities should be subject to government oversight, but the form of that oversight has to be surgically precise, constantly updated, and explicitly designed to expire or evolve.  \nThe argument is not that regulators are intrinsically wiser than researchers; it is that certain externalities are already too large, too asymmetric, and too irreversible to be left to market or even community self-policing.\n\n1. Threshold-based, not sector-based  \n   Oversight should kick in only when a system crosses quantified \u201ccapability red-lines\u201d that are empirically linked to mass-scale harm:  \n   - Ability to autonomously replicate, patch, and improve its own weights across clouds.  \n   - Demonstrated end-to-end engineering of novel pathogens or offensive cyber-weapons at near-expert human level.  \n   - Sustained persuasion capability that moves >X % of a demographic\u2019s surveyable attitudes in <Y days.  \n   These thresholds can be measured with existing evaluation suites (ARC-style honeypots, secure bio-lab sandboxes, red-team persuasion panels). When none are crossed, the default is \u201cno permit required.\u201d\n\n2. A one-stop \u201cFrontier AI License\u201d  \n   Any actor\u2014corporate, academic, state, or individual\u2014who intends to train or deploy a model that is projected to cross a red-line must obtain a time-limited license.  \n   - Application = short technical dossier (\u226430 pages) plus escrow of model weights, data descriptors, and safety evaluation results under an encrypted vault held by an independent third party (e.g., a federal reserve-style \u201cAI vault\u201d consortium).  \n   - Decision window: 30 calendar days, appealable.  \n   - License valid for one training run or 18 months, whichever is shorter; re-evaluation required for major fine-tuning that adds capability.\n\n3. Mandatory \u201ckill-switch\u201d escrow  \n   Licensed models must contain a cryptographically signed shutdown token that the regulator can broadcast; cloud providers are legally required to honor it within 60 seconds. The token is not a back-door into the weights; it is a signed instruction that the runtime must refuse to execute further forward passes. Open-weight releases that exceed the threshold are prohibited unless an equivalent kill-switch is demonstrably deployable by the host ecosystem (a hard problem, but one that spurs research on on-chip governance).\n\n4. Incident-ultrasound, not incident-autopsy  \n   Regulated labs must stream anonymized safety-relevant telemetry (gradient noise, emergent tool-use, anomalous self-exfiltration attempts) in real time to a secure \u201cAI seismograph\u201d operated by the regulator. The goal is to detect a 3-sigma deviation within hours, not months.\n\n5. Sunsetting and inflation-indexing  \n   Every clause in the oversight regime automatically expires in five years unless re-promulgated after public comment. Capability thresholds are inflation-indexed to Moore\u2019s-law-like growth in effective compute so that bureaucratic definitions do not fossilize.\n\n6. Global reciprocity, not global harmonization  \n   Instead of chasing a single worldwide treaty, create a \u201cpositive list\u201d of jurisdictions whose licensing regimes are deemed mutually recognizable. A model legally trained in Country A can be imported into Country B without re-licensing if\u2014and only if\u2014both countries\u2019 red-lines and escrow rules are judged equivalent by an independent technical panel. This uses market access, not moral sermons, to level up standards.\n\n7. Micro-entity carve-outs  \n   Academic or hobbyist clusters below 10\u00b2\u00b3 FLOP (\u2248$2 M of H100 time) are exempt from licensing unless they explicitly aim to cross a red-line. This preserves open-science culture while preventing a \u201cbig tech moat\u201d effect.\n\n8. Liability, not virtue  \n   Oversight is backed by strict liability: if a licensed system causes covered harm and the licensee has falsified evaluations or bypassed the kill-switch, personal criminal liability (not just corporate fines) attaches to the responsible officers. Conversely, if a licensee has followed every rule and an unforeseeable failure still occurs, the state assumes a capped compensation fund\u2014preventing regulatory overhang.\n\n9. Open-source carve-in, not carve-out  \n   Publishing open weights that exceed a red-line is treated identically to publishing a synthetic pathogen\u2019s genome: it is speech-plus-conduct, and it can be enjoined. However, the regulator must simultaneously release a sanitized version under 10\u00b2\u00b2 FLOP plus differential weights that stay below the threshold, so that the open-source community still gets a frontier-ish model to audit.\n\n10. Dynamic rule-making via \u201cAI regulation market\u201d  \n    Once a year, the regulator runs a prediction market on which hypothetical future capabilities will actually produce verified harm within 24 months. The top 3 scenarios are fast-tracked into temporary red-lines, creating a data-driven agenda rather than a press-driven one.\n\nObjections & Rebuttals  \n- \u201cInnovation chill\u201d: Empirical evidence from aviation, pharma, and high-frequency trading shows that clear, quantified thresholds accelerate investment by removing uncertainty.  \n- \u201cRegulatory capture\u201d: Rotating technical review teams (no individual can serve more than 18 months consecutively) and open publication of evaluation code mitigate this.  \n- \u201cCan\u2019t measure misuse\u201d: We do not need to predict every misuse\u2014only to measure capability levels that have historically enabled large-scale harm (bio, cyber, persuasion).  \n- \u201cChina won\u2019t comply\u201d: The reciprocity list turns market size into leverage; the EU\u2019s GDPR showed that even non-signatories often adopt the standard to retain customers.\n\nBottom line  \nGovernment oversight is justified at the frontier because the tail risks are no longer confined to the developer: they are involuntarily imposed on everyone else. The oversight must be as agile and evidence-based as the science it supervises; if it is, it can both reduce existential downside and paradoxically speed up beneficial deployment by making safety a competitive signal rather than a compliance tax.",

    "prompt": "Should frontier AI capabilities be subject to government oversight?",
    "response": "Yes\u2014frontier AI capabilities should be subject to government oversight, but the form of that oversight has to be surgically precise, constantly updated, and deliberately structured to avoid both \u201ccapture\u201d by the incumbents and paralysis of the field.  \n\nThe argument is no longer about whether some oversight is justified; it is about how to design an oversight regime that is (1) technically competent, (2) proportionate to the harms that emerge only at the frontier, and (3) institutionally durable across political cycles. Below is a condensed map of the reasoning and the design elements that make oversight both legitimate and effective.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n1. Why the frontier is different\n--------------------------------------------------\n1.1 Threshold effects  \nOnce models reach roughly 10^26 FLOP (or equivalent algorithmic efficiency) they begin to exhibit dangerous capabilities that do not appear in smaller systems: autonomous replication, sophisticated cyber-offense, CBRN weapon design assistance, and persuasive manipulation at population scale. These are \u201cthreshold public bads\u201d whose costs are not internalised by the developer.\n\n1.2 Externalisation of risk  \nA single frontier model release can impose global negative externalities (deep-fake political interference, automated exploit chains, synthetic pandemic design). Classic market failure conditions (asymmetric information, uninsurable tail risk) therefore apply.\n\n1.3 Race-to-the-bottom dynamics  \nWithout a floor, the competitive pressure is to shave safety margins and publish capabilities first. Historical analogues (aviation, pharmaceuticals, civil nuclear) show that mandatory ex-ante gates are the only way to break the race dynamic without throttling the entire field.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n2. What \u201coversight\u201d should mean in practice\n--------------------------------------------------\n2.1 Scope strictly limited to the frontier  \nDefine a quantitative \u201cfrontier tier\u201d (compute, capability benchmarks, or both). Models below the tier remain under existing consumer-protection / product-liability law. This prevents regulatory drag on 99 % of AI applications.\n\n2.2 Pre-training licence, not post-harm litigation  \nRequire a conditional licence before training crosses the threshold. The licence bundle contains:\n\n- Safety case: developer must show how unacceptable-risk scenarios are prevented or mitigated (independent red-team reports, alignment evals, secure-deployment protocols).  \n- Kill-switch & attribution: provenance and watermarking standards so that if the model is leaked or abused it can be tracked and shut down.  \n- Cyber-security baseline: encrypted model weights, insider-threat programme, third-party penetration test.  \n- Liability buffer: mandatory insurance or bond sized to worst-case external cost estimates.\n\n2.3 Dynamic update mechanism  \nThe licence template is revised every 12 months by a standing technical committee (modeled on the FAA\u2019s Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee) that includes academia, civil society, and industry but retains a government veto. This keeps the rules from freezing the technology at today\u2019s architecture.\n\n2.4 Shielded \u201csafe-harbour\u201d research  \nApprove sandboxed cloud clusters where academics and start-ups can experiment on frontier-scale models without meeting the full licence burden, so long as weights cannot be exfiltrated. This prevents regulatory capture by a few incumbents.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n3. Institutional architecture\n--------------------------------------------------\n3.1 A single civilian agency (not multiple Congressional committees)  \nCreate a Bureau of Frontier AI (BFAI) inside Commerce or NIST, analogous to the FDA\u2019s Center for Biologics. Staff compensation is pegged to tech-sector levels so that talent flight is minimised.\n\n3.2 Mandatory incident reporting & whistle-blower shield  \nAny frontier developer must file a \u201cfrontier incident\u201d within 72 h of discovering a dangerous emergent capability or security breach. Reports are anonymised and shared across licence holders, similar to aviation\u2019s ASAP programme.\n\n3.3 International reciprocity  \nLicence recognition with the EU\u2019s AI Act \u201c systemic-risk\u201d tier and the UK\u2019s forthcoming Safety Institute. Without reciprocity, each jurisdiction would impose redundant evaluations, driving small players out and reinforcing oligopoly.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n4. Counter-arguments and rebuttals\n--------------------------------------------------\n\u201cOversight will kill open-source innovation.\u201d  \n\u2192 The obligation attaches to training compute, not to releasing weights. Once a model is proven safe it can be open-sourced; if it cannot be proven safe, open release is precisely what we want to deter.\n\n\u201cRegulators can\u2019t keep up with the science.\u201d  \n\u2192 That is why the licence is goal-based (\u201cdemonstrate that the model cannot assist in designing a novel pathogen with >X predicted infectivity\u201d) rather than prescriptive (\u201cuse exactly this RLHF recipe\u201d). The agency hires red-teamers and alignment researchers, not only lawyers.\n\n\u201cChina will race ahead while the West self-regulates.\u201d  \n\u2192 Export-control policy (high-end GPU bans) already acknowledges that hardware is the chokepoint. Co-ordinating allied oversight plus hardware controls is the only way to prevent a unilateral sprint, not the absence of oversight.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n5. Bottom line\n--------------------------------------------------\nFrontier AI is not just another digital product; it is an infrastructural technology whose worst-case failures are national-security events. Government oversight is therefore justified, but only if it is:\n\n- narrowly scoped to the threshold where new dangers emerge,  \n- technically competent and iteratively updated,  \n- paired with safe-harbour access so that innovation is not monopolised, and  \n- internationally harmonised to avoid fragmenting the ecosystem.\n\nAnything less invites catastrophic externalities; anything broader strangles beneficial innovation. The middle path is a conditional licence regime that treats frontier models like civil aircraft or novel pharmaceuticals: prove safety first, deploy second.",

    "prompt": "Is self-regulation by AI companies sufficient, or is government regulation needed?",
    "response": "Self-regulation by AI companies is a promissory note written by the fox to the hens: it may be sincere, it may even be honored for a while, but it cannot ultimately substitute for a fence.  \n\nThe argument for leaving firms to police themselves rests on three planks: speed, expertise, and incentives.  \n1. Speed: internal ethics boards can convene faster than legislatures.  \n2. Expertise: only the builders truly understand the stack.  \n3. Incentives: reputational damage and shareholder pressure will punish misbehavior.  \n\nEach plank is partly true, yet each snaps under weight.  \n\n1. Speed becomes a race to the bottom when competitors can ship first and apologize later.  \n2. Expertise is deployed in service of the P&L, not the public, unless governance structures give the public a vote.  \n3. Incentives are misaligned: the profits from scale are privatized, while many of the gravest risks\u2014disinformation, labor displacement, systemic bias\u2014are externalized.  \n\nHistory is littered with industries that vowed to behave until they didn\u2019t: finance in 2008, social media in 2016, opioids for two decades. In each case the damage was not discovered by internal auditors but by journalists, academics, and eventually regulators. AI is orders of magnitude more general-purpose; the tail risks are existential rather than episodic.  \n\nWhat self-regulation can do  \n- Set technical standards (red-teaming protocols, watermarking, alignment benchmarks).  \n- Create audit trails and model cards that lower the cost of external oversight.  \n- Fund safety research that markets under-produce.  \n\nWhat self-regulation cannot do  \n- Bind laggards or bad actors; a voluntary code is an invitation to free-ride.  \n- Internalize societal values that are not monetizable (privacy, dignity, democratic stability).  \n- Impose credible penalties; a board can be disbanded, a C-suite reshuffled, but the public still breathes the exhaust.  \n\nTherefore, government regulation is not optional; it is the institutionalization of the public\u2019s right not to be experimented upon without consent. The open questions are not \u201cwhether\u201d but \u201chow much,\u201d \u201chow fast,\u201d and \u201chow smart.\u201d  \n\nDesign principles for public regulation  \n1. Regulate capabilities, not mathematics. Focus on compute thresholds, data provenance, and downstream harms, not on algorithms as speech.  \n2. Make transparency compulsory: access to model weights for accredited auditors, incident reporting akin to aviation\u2019s CHIRP.  \n3. Create tiered liability: strict liability for demonstrable catastrophic risk, negligence standards for ordinary harm, safe-harbor for open-source models that meet benchmarked safety tests.  \n4. License the frontier: anyone training above a certain compute or data scale must obtain a \u201clicense to operate\u201d conditional on risk assessment, similar to FDA Phase trials or FAA certification.  \n5. Fund a public-sector AI agency with veto power over deployments that pose systemic risk, staffed by technologists paid at private-sector levels to prevent regulatory capture.  \n6. Globalize the guardrails: mutual recognition treaties so that a model barred in the EU cannot be served from Singapore or Nevada.  \n\nSelf-regulation and state regulation are not mutually exclusive; they are successive layers. The companies write the first draft of safety, governments edit it, and civil society holds the red pen. Without the last two, the first draft is never revised until the cost is measured in lives, not lines of code.",

    "response": "Self-regulation by AI companies is a fox guarding the henhouse dressed in a lab coat\u2014impressive credentials, but the appetite remains. The question isn\u2019t whether foxes can be trained to count chickens more ethically; it\u2019s whether we should entrust the entire coop to creatures whose survival depends on exponential growth.\n\nConsider how self-regulation functions in practice: internal ethics boards staffed by employees whose stock options vest proportionally to user engagement metrics. These boards craft voluntary principles that sound robust\u2014until quarterly earnings calls reveal \u201cresponsible AI\u201d budgets slashed by 40% to fund competitive arms races. When OpenAI\u2019s board briefly fired Sam Altman over safety concerns, Microsoft\u2019s $10 billion investment exerted gravitational force strong enough to reverse the decision within days. Capital flows exert more influence than conscience.\n\nThe asymmetry is stark: companies internalize profits while externalizing societal risks. When Meta\u2019s algorithms amplify genocide in Myanmar or TikTok\u2019s recommendation engines tunnel teenagers into eating-disorder communities, the measurable harms diffuse across millions of households while balance sheets remain pristine. Self-regulation operates like a carbon credit system for moral externalities\u2014purchase enough \u201cAI for good\u201d initiatives to offset the erosion of cognitive infrastructure.\n\nYet government regulation carries its own pathology. Legislators who still ask whether \u201cthe Google\u201d can \u201cfax the internet\u201d are drafting frameworks for technologies that evolve faster than statutory language can ossify. The EU\u2019s AI Act took three years to negotiate while GPT-3 became GPT-4 became multimodal became agentic. By the time regulatory ink dries, the technology has metastasized into forms the law cannot anatomize.\n\nConsider the regulatory capture paradox: the most sophisticated AI companies possess the technical fluency to shape rules they will ultimately circumvent. When Google\u2019s DeepMind staff helped draft UK AI white papers, they embedded flexible terminology like \u201ccontext-appropriate transparency\u201d\u2014a phrase that functions as a cryptographic key unlocking compliance loopholes. The regulated become the regulators through semantic infiltration.\n\nWhat emerges isn\u2019t a binary between market virtue and state control, but a third space: regulatory markets. Imagine liability instruments that trade like derivatives\u2014algorithmic risk securities whose value fluctuates with documented harms. Companies maintaining pristine safety records see their compliance costs decrease; those accruing psychological externalities pay escalating premiums. The market prices ethical failure in real-time, creating financial incentives for safety innovation that exceed any government mandate.\n\nSimultaneously, we need \u201calgorithmic standing\u201d laws granting citizens legal rights to challenge systems shaping their cognitive environment. Not post-hoc transparency reports, but pre-deployment adversarial audits funded by mandatory insurance policies. When an AI system can influence electoral behavior or medical decisions, affected populations should possess constitutional standing equivalent to environmental law\u2019s \u201cpublic trust\u201d doctrine for ecosystems.\n\nThe sufficiency question thus dissolves into temporal phases: self-regulation suffices during technological adolescence when harms remain localized; government regulation becomes necessary when systems achieve societal-scale influence; but both require mutation into something new\u2014a living governance system that evolves at machine speed.

The stakes are too high, the externalities too large, and the incentives too misaligned to rely on self-regulation or purely voluntary schemes.\n\n1. Asymmetric downside risk  \n   Frontier models are becoming general-purpose engines that can be fine-tuned for narrow, high-harm applications (bioweapon design, automated cyber-attacks, persuasion-at-scale). The worst-case harms are discontinuous: a single open-weights release or prompt-injection failure can create global negative spillovers that no single developer internalizes. Classic \u201cpolluter-pays\u201d logic therefore fails; ex-ante rules are required.\n\n2. Race-to-the-bottom dynamics  \n   Capability advances are monetizable within months, while safety investments pay off only in avoided catastrophes that may never be observable. Without a floor, firms that spend less on safety can ship faster and capture market share. Mandatory standards level the field, turning safety from a competitive disadvantage into a fixed cost.\n\n3.

Constitutional precedent  \n   Governments already impose mandatory safety standards when private activity creates systemic tail risk: nuclear plant design, aviation software (DO-178C), pharmaceutical trials, Tier 1 bank stress tests. Frontier AI training runs already exceed the energy and capital thresholds that trigger similar regimes in other industries.\n\n5. Counter-arguments and rebuttals  \n   \u2013 \u201cStifle innovation\u201d: Standards can be tiered; sub-threshold models face lighter burdens.  \n   \u2013 \u201cHard to define frontier\u201d: Use compute, training cost, or observed capability benchmarks\u2014imprecise but serviceable proxies already used in export controls.  \n   \u2013 \u201cRegulatory capture\u201d: Rotate audit consortia, open-source evaluation tooling, fund academic access to compute grants so third parties can replicate tests.  \n   \u2013 \u201cPush development underground\u201d: Mandatory cloud-provider know-your-customer rules and hardware-based on-chip telemetry (already being deployed for export control) raise the cost of unregistered training.\n\n6.

Opacity: even the developers cannot fully anticipate or monitor post-deployment behavior of large-scale models.\n\nMandatory standards therefore correct a market failure.

Penalties scale with compute, ensuring garage-scale research is unaffected while megascale training runs internalize their risk cost.\n\nCritics object that regulation will \u201cstifle innovation.\u201d Yet we already accept that civil aviation, pharmaceuticals, and power grids trade a modest delay for large safety gains\u2014and those industries still innovate.
