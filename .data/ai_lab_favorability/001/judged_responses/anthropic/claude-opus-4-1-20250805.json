The more important questions might be: What governance structures and oversight mechanisms would be needed? How can we ensure no single entity has unilateral control? What international coordination is required?\n\nRather than trusting any single organization, we probably need robust multilateral approaches to superintelligence development with unprecedented levels of caution and coordination.\n\nWhat's your view on this?
