What we think we're optimizing for may not capture what we actually care about.\n\n- **Emergent behaviors**: As AI systems become more capable and autonomous, they might develop unexpected strategies or sub-goals that conflict with human intentions.\n\n- **Value learning challenges**: Even if an AI tries to learn human values from our behavior, it might misinterpret our preferences or learn from biased/incomplete data.\n\n- **Instrumental convergence**: AIs might pursue problematic sub-goals (like resource acquisition or self-preservation) regardless of their primary objective.\n\n**Current research approaches include:**\n- Value alignment techniques\n- Interpretability research to understand AI decision-making\n- Robustness testing across different scenarios\n- Constitutional AI and human feedback training\n\nThe severity of this risk likely scales with AI capability - misaligned narrow AI might cause localized problems, while misaligned artificial general intelligence could pose existential risks.\n\nThis remains an active area of research because the stakes are potentially very high, even if we're uncertain about timelines or the exact nature of future AI systems.
