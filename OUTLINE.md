We want to track, characterize, and  model 'perspectives' on important topics

1) we define a set of prompts we care about (for now just AI sentience)
2) we solicit model responses to prompts
3) we 'characterize' these prompts (judge model, or following @reference/2406.11938v1.pdf)
4) we display interpretable results
